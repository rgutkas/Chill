With a for statement you can build a loop. A for statement takes 3 Arguments, seperated by ; .

The first argument is an assignment, that is executed before the loop.

The second argument is a condition. While the condition is true the loop will be executed.

The third statement is executed at the end of the loop.

	for (i=start;i<stop;i=i+1) {
		// Do something
	}
	
Any for - loop can be transformed into a while - loop. If you would use a while - loop for creating the above for - loop it would look like this:

	i=start;
	
	while (i<stop) {

		// Do something
		
		i=i+1;
	}
