Array's in Chill are custom types. Before you can use an array you have to declare an array type.

	array arr [];

Then you can declare a variable of the array type.

	arr variable a;

Array variables in Chill are variables that can store more than one value. Each value stored in an array is indexed by a key.
	
	for (i=0;i<4;i=i+1) {
		a[i]=i;
	}

	return a; 	
	
	=> [0,1,2,3]

Each array in chill knows it current length. This can be retrived with the length attribute. We can change for instance the last line of the example above.

	return a.length;
	
	=> 4
	
Array's in chill are self growing, so if you assign a value to an index that doesn't exist yet, this index will be created automatically.

Depending on thy typing level you may or must specify a type in an array declaration. The type of the index is specified between []. The type of the values stored in an array are specified after contains.

	array arr2 [integer] contains integer; 
 
 For performing an action on every value stored in an array there is an special for - loop. The variable given after each will be assigned the current index of the array specified after in. 
 
	for (each index in a) {
	    a[index]=a[index]*2;
	}
