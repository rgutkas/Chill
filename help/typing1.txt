You can store values in variables. A Variable can hold values.You can choose between two variants to tell Chill that you use a variable.
If you assign a value to a variable, you can use it. This variable can hold any type.

	a		=> Error
	a=0		=> ok
	a		=> 0
	a="text"	=> ok
	a		=> text

Or you can declare a variable. After you assign a value to it you can use it.

	variable x	=> ok
	x=0		=> ok
	x		=> 0

This way you can give a variable a specific type, which means it only can hold one special type of value.

	integer variable i=0;
	number variable n=0.1;
	character variable c='s';
	string variable s="text;
	boolean variable b=true;

You can even declare it as constant, which is a variable that you only can assign a value once.

	constant t=true;
	boolean constant f=false;
